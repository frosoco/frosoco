	<p>The first university facility of its kind in the nation, Ricker Dining is Stanford's highly lauded peanut-sensitive dining environment. In recognition of the growing number of students with peanut allergies, we've taken the steps necessary to provide a safe, full-featured facility in which peanut-sensitive and non-peanut-sensitive diners alike can enjoy the best of what Stanford Dining has to offer. With its beautiful dining location on the west side of campus complete with a state-of-the art meeting room, lounge areas and trellised patio, it's best to enjoy your meal al fresco.</p>
	<p>Peanuts are quickly becoming one of the world's most allergenic foods, and 3 million Americans currently suffer from all levels of nut and peanut allergies. Here at Stanford, some students have such severe peanut allergies that they must avoid eating in our dining halls for fear of contact with peanut material residue on countertops, breathing in vapors from peanut shell fumes, or ingesting as little as one-five thousandth of a teaspoon of food containing peanuts.</p>
	<p>In response to a clear need for peanut allergy awareness in university dining services nationwide, Stanford Dining has made Ricker Dining the first on-campus dining facility in the country to designate itself a peanut sensitive environment. Stanford Dining is paving the way for other institutions to follow in our footsteps, and we are proud to be able to meet such a pressing health need of our students.</p>
