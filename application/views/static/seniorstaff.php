They enjoy sharing their interests with students in FroSoCo.  
Among their personal interests Bryan and Cheryl would consider themselves pseudo foodies.  They enjoy fine dining when they can. They also enjoy plays, concerts, movies and traveling.  Bryan has great interest in sports and has played basketball, baseball, and football. He has also coached high school baseball and more recently T-ball. He enjoys watching most sports. Cheryl is growing to appreciate sports. She played softball in high school but took up running as a passion in college, a passion she hopes to get back to soon. They have both served as mentors to high school and college students at their church and through various non-profits (Young Black Scholars and EtuSchule Educational Project). They truly enjoy spending time with students and supporting them as they grow. Although they hope to support students in this way on a daily basis they also are excited about exposing students to the things they enjoy such as the arts, education, and sports.</p>
