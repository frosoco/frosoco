        <h2>Explorations of the Rubik's Cube</h2>
        <h4>Kensen Shi</h4>
        <p>In this seminar, we will learn how to solve the Rubik's cube. No prior experience is necessary, and high-quality cubes will be provided to all registered participants. There are many different methods of solving the cube -- as a baseline, we will learn a very basic layer-by-layer method, but several advanced variations and optimizations will also be presented. If time permits, we will briefly explore other solving methods, blindfold cubing, cube mathematics, and/or other twisty puzzles.</p>

        <h2>Humans of FroSoCo: This is our Story</h2>
        <h4>Mirae Lee and Carolyn Kravitz</h4>
        <p>
			Humans of FroSoCo will be a journey through our collective history! These are our stories, and we want to share them. We will take a photojournalist's approach, in the style of renowned photography blog, Humans of New York, to photograph and interview each resident. Students will be taught basic photography skills before being turned loose on the world. Owning your own camera is not necessary.
