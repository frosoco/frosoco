# Freshman-Sophomore College (FroSoCo)
This is the source code for the FSC website. 

### Resources
This website is built on [CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter), a fantastic framework for PHP based applications. Jen Segers' [CodeIgniter-Template-Library](https://github.com/jenssegers/CodeIgniter-Template-Library) is leveraged as our templating engine, and the [DataMapper ORM](http://datamapper.wanwizard.eu/) is used to make the SQL life easier. Data is stored in [mySQL](http://www.mysql.com/), and of course everything is currently hosted by [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu/).
